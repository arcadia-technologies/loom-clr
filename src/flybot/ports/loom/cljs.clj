;; What's going on here?
;; 
;; Loom uses `extend` extensively to provide protocol implementations for its
;; various graph types. ClojureScript does not offer `extend` (only
;; `extend-type` and `extend-protocol` are available). I did not want to
;; refactor all the graph type definitions to use `extend-type` (either to
;; duplicate all the protocol method impls, or delegate to the shared protocol
;; fns that could be provided to `extend` in Clojure). Further, the protocol
;; method impl maps in `loom.graph` are public, so I didn't want to change them
;; from the perspective of a Clojure consumer (which might base other graph
;; impls on those "base" maps).
;; 
;; This namespace is my hack/solution. Protocol method impl maps are now defined
;; using `def-protocol-impls`, which behaves just as `def` in Clojure. But in
;; ClojureScript, `def-protocol-impls` stores the provided map. An
;; "implementation" of `extend` for ClojureScript is also provided here, which
;; looks up those previously-defined maps, and uses their contents as the basis
;; for an equivalent `extend-type` form.
;; 
;; There are various aspects of this that are wince-inducing, including the
;; questionable-but-working resolution of `extend` map symbols, and the ad-hoc
;; pattern matching and "application" on the ClojureScript side of certain
;; functions that _loom_ uses to manipulate `extend` protocol method impl maps
;; (`get-in`, `merge`). While such things are completely fine in Clojure, if
;; later changes to loom manipulate those maps using other functions, the code
;; below will need to be changed to accommodate them.
;; 
;; For all sorts of reasons, this is _not_ a general-purpose `extend`
;; replacement, and so ClojureScript consumers of Loom will not be able to
;; e.g. reliably reuse base protocol method impl maps as one can in Clojure.
